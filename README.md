# Toplogical-Sort
This C++ code implements a topological sorting algorithm for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using Depth-First Search (DFS) and backtracking techniques. Topological sorting is used to order the vertices of a graph in such a way that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering.
